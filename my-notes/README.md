# My Notes for MCP Course I will use this file to keep track of what I am learning
## ðŸ“˜ Lesson 1: What is MCP?

- MCP stands for Modular Cognition Pattern.
- It's a way to structure intelligent agent behavior in steps.
- MCP helps break down tasks into **thinking** and **doing**.
- I'm excited to learn how it works with AI Agents!

ðŸ§  My takeaway:
> MCP is kind of like giving the agent a recipe or playbook it can follow.
